    """
    Run m on x in batches of size bs, and concatenate the results.

    If x is a dict, treat it as a dict of arrays, each of which is batched
        together. This requires that the length of each array is the same.

    If m returns a dict, treat it as a dict of arrays, each of which is
        concatenated together. This requires that the length of each array is
        the same.

    Arguments
    ---------
    m : function
        A function which takes a batch of data and returns a batch of data.
    x : array or dict of arrays
        The data to be batched.
    bs : int
        The batch size.
    pbar : function
        A function which takes an iterable and returns an iterable. This is
        used to wrap the iterable over the batches of data to produce a pbar.

    Returns
    -------
    array or dict of arrays
        The result of running m on x in batches of size bs.
